# Raycast-Interface
Simple interface made with Pygame to complement a Raycaster model.

Before anything else: the raycaster itself was made following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYRrGTC7GtA

The interface allows you to design a 8x8 map. 

You can place walls using Right click and remove it with Left click.

Once in the "game" the walls will turn yellow if the rays are colliding with it.
